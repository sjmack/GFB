        <p>This is a browser for the HLA allele-frequency heat-maps generated as supporting online material for: 
            Solberg et al. (2008) Balancing selection and heterogeneity across the classical human leukocyte antigen
            loci: A meta-analytic review of 497 population studies Human Immunology 69(7):443-64. <a
            href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2632948/" target="NewWindow">doi:
            10.1016/j.humimm.2008.05.001</a>
        </p>

        <p>The HLA loci and alleles for which maps are available were included in the Solberg meta-analysis. Not every identified HLA locus or allele will be represented by a map. No maps are available for alleles in the Solberg data compilation that were observed only in admixed or migrant populations. </p>
        
        <p>White dots on the maps represent indigenous populations included in the Solberg analysis.</p>
        
        <p>To view a map in greater detail, turn your device to the left or right. The top map is enlarged when the device is turned to the left and the bottom map is enlarged when the device is turned to the right. </p>

        <p>To make the GFB into an iOS app, tap the share button <img src = 'share.png' width = '20px' style='vertical-align: middle;'>, and select "Add to Home Screen".</p>
